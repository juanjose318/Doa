                    Macklemore has confirmed that he will be performing on DOA. There were rumours he was not coming because of his broken leg, but the artist Tweeted that a broken leg wouldn't stop him. He said he'd put his best "tags" on and give us his 200% on stage.

            <h2>2pac is Confirmed, back from the grave to the stage!</h2>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Juan Muñoz, <strong>Published:</strong>Today</p>
            <p>
                2pac isn't dead, he just took a long vacation after being threaten by some mysterous rapper. He said his life took the wrong direction and he didn't want to put his family in danger, so he decided to escape to china. He was working there as seller at McDonald's. After 10 years, he came out of his grave, ready to reach the top again after getting rid of the person who apparently was trying to kill. You never know with these people nowadays. Maybe he just faked his death so he could run to china to fulfill his dream of working in a foreign country.
